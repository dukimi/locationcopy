# Minecraft Location Copy Mod
A simple Location Copy

This mod makes copying coordinates in Minecraft much more convenient.

Copying is also possible with F3+C, but instead of complex commands that cannot be used without cheats, pressing the basic key G key copies only the coordinates neatly. (G key can be changed to another key in key binding)
